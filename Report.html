                <p>To begin the design process, I started by creating a simplistic wireframe for the slideshow page of my site which was originally going to be my homepage. 
                    I then began experimenting with different colours and fonts to see what they would look like when placed against other colours. 
                    After I had selected a palette which suited the website, I got to work implementing the initial, 
                    mobile friendly version of my website and it didnâ€™t take me long to notice a few design aspects with needed to be altered.

               <p>Firstly, the logo colours needed changing for the sake of accessibility as it was barely noticeable against the background colour, 
                    and if someone with standard vision struggled to notice it against the background then it would be near impossible for the visually impaired. 
                    In order to help increase the accessibility of my website I therefor changed the colour of the logo to contrast its background and as a result, 
                    the logo stood out much more and was very easy to notice. This decision to change the logo colour eventually lead me to change the colour scheme
                    for my website entirely which will be discussed later.
