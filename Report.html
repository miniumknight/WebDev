        </div>
        <div class="mainTextContainer">
            <p>To begin the design process, I started by creating a simplistic wireframe for the slideshow page of my site which was originally going to be my homepage. 
                I then began experimenting with different colours and fonts to see what they would look like when placed against other colours. 
                After I had selected a palette which suited the website, I got to work implementing the initial, 
                mobile friendly version of my website and it didn’t take me long to notice a few design aspects with needed to be altered.
            </p>
            <p>Firstly, the logo colours needed changing for the sake of accessibility as it was barely noticeable against the background colour, 
                and if someone with standard vision struggled to notice it against the background then it would be near impossible for the visually impaired. 
                In order to help increase the accessibility of my website I therefor changed the colour of the logo to contrast its background and as a result, 
                the logo stood out much more and was very easy to notice. This decision to change the logo colour eventually lead me to change the colour scheme
                for my website entirely which will be discussed later.
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the navigation bar looked very bland and under-designed to me and, since according to the research of Renee Garett, Jason Chiu, Ly Zhang and 
                Sean D. Young, PhD (2017) “The seven website design elements most often discussed in relation to user engagement in the reviewed studies were navigation (62.86%), 
                graphical representation (60%), organization (42.86%), content utility (37.14%), purpose (31.43%), simplicity (31.43%), and readability (31.43%)” (Section 4). 
                It is very important that the navigation bar is well designed, engaging and accessible, because it is arguably the most important aspect of the website and in many 
                cases the first place the user looks upon first viewing the site. Therefor I moved the logo from the header to the navigation bar and changed the layout of the bar so 
                that the logo was on the left and the navigation links were on the right, this change, though simplistic, dramatically increased the quality of my website and would be 
                much more appealing to the target audience.
